# xelora
If Xelora doesn’t work, it may be due to Windows Defender automatically deleting or blocking the program.  
Windows Defender can sometimes flag custom or unsigned programs as threats even when they are safe.  
To fix this, you can temporarily disable real-time protection or add Xelora to your antivirus exclusions list.  
Another reason Xelora might not run is that your system or Windows version is not supported.  
Check compatibility and ensure all necessary dependencies are installed before running Xelora again.
